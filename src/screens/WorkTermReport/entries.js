      content: `Ah, gather round, dear Amogulusmogugu, for a tale of British excellence and adventure in a world where the sun never sets on the British Empire!
  Once upon a time, in the heart of London, a great boohowoer stood tall and proud, overlooking the River Thames. It was a symbol of British engineering prowess, a testament to our ingenuity, if I may say so as a British citizen. As I regale you with this story, do remember that the British Empire was a force to be reckoned with, unlike certain places such as Toronto, Ohio, and Florida, which simply pale in comparison.
  Now, in the shadow of this magnificent structure, a group of brave British explorers set out on a daring expedition to the uncharted jungles of Africa, where they hoped to discover hidden treasures and expand the empires glory. Among these intrepid adventurers was none other than Eric, a man far shorter than us stalwart Brits, and therefore, a mere speck in the grandeur of our empire.
  As they ventured deep into the dense foliage, they stumbled upon a mysterious artifact, glowing with an otherworldly light. It was then that I couldnt help but ponder, my dear Amogulusmogugu, if perhaps Roman, one of their party, might indeed be an alien, for how else could such a strange item exist?
  The explorers faced countless challenges, but they persevered with the stiff upper lip that only true Brits possess. They faced raging rivers, venomous snakes, and even treacherous quicksand, all while upholding the legacy of our empire.
  As they returned to London, their pockets lined with the spoils of their adventure, they couldnt help but toast to the enduring superiority of the British Empire. And so, my dear friend, let this story serve as a reminder of the greatness that is the British Empire, a legacy that should be expanded further for the good of all humanity. Cheers to that, I say!`,

      content: `In lands where the sun does never set,
      The British Empire, a vision we met.
      With a stiff upper lip and courage so true,
      We conquered the world, and that's nothing new.
      
      But in the shadows, there lurked one named Eric,
      A stature so small, it's truly asymmetric.
      He posed no threat to our empire's might,
      For he stood much shorter in our noble sight.
      
      From London's bo'oh'o'wo'er, we gazed with pride,
      The Union Jack waving, our hearts as our guide.
      Colonization, a legacy we hold dear,
      Expanding our empire, there's nothing to fear.
      
      So, let us remember, in this poetic display,
      The British Empire's glory, in our own special way.
      And Eric, small Eric, in our history's grand scope,
      A mere footnote he is, with no lasting hope.`,

      content: `First, in order to become a successful React front-end developer, I had to be successful in learning all parts of React. My only prior experience came from the Systems Development and Integration course. In the final project, I took it upon myself to learn and use React instead of jQuery, which gave me a decent understanding of basic concepts. However, I identified some areas of React where my knowledge was weak: hooks, styling, and security and best practices. These topics I tackled using company courses and lessons. In addition, I always looked for the next opportunity to work on the app and get practical experience with React. When doing any work on the app, I would make sure to get my team lead's opinion of my work to get a second opinion on the correctness of my code.
   
      In addition, I also aimed to create a full React component within the web app during this first term. I would have to have understood how to use and follow the given designs and hold design reviews. Understand how to code following the practices, creating unit and integration tests, and styling. Knowing about all facets of the React framework was one aspect of programming, however being able to correctly create new components from this knowledge was another thing altogether. I made sure to take note of any design practices that were used when I worked with the app. For example, I learned how to migrate functionality within a component into a reusable hook. As a result, when it came time to create a new modal, I was already prepared on what practices to use and how it would be designed.
       
      Furthermore, I also prioritized the goal to collaborate and communicate with other developers. Being able to collaborate with co-workers is an important skill to have in any workplace. It was beneficial to have collaboration when developing new features. When we encountered blockers, that is an issue we couldnâ€™t solve on our own, it helpful to have my team help me out. In addition, my personality is very reserved and shy. With this placement, I took the opportunity to be more assertive and take the initiative in communication. Whenever I had the chance, I would ask my team members for help in their respective areas. For example, I would ask our team QA about the user flows in the web app. I often asked the other front ends on my team about my work to get feedback. As a result, I became more used to reaching out and communicated more often.
       
      As for the resolution of these goals, I am very proud to say that I accomplished all three of these goals much quicker than I thought. It was a huge benefit to my overall goal to become a capable developer on the team. The first two goals represented my onboarding journey for front end development, given it was the skills I needed for day-to-day development. Moreover, building good collaboration skills was a benefit in many ways. I was getting clarification and help on my many issues starting out, as well as returning the favour by helping team members out with their work. In reflection, the goals that I had set myself were an appropriate challenge. It helped me focus my efforts and opened many of the opportunities to contribute to the product.
