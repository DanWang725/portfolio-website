These include retail, banking and IT software services, Point of Sale (POS) for commercial retail services, and ATMs. An interesting piece of information is that they had invented the cash register. The Waterloo office which I was working at focused on their interactive teller software solution as well as other software-based services. `,

      content: `Prior to my placement, I had set a few simple goals since going into my position. I did not have a clear idea of what to expect, it was a better idea to start the job with an open mind and make goals from there. Thus, after my first day, I aimed to learn all the react topics. I also set a goal to collaborate with my team. Finally, I aimed to learn more about the design aspect of front end. 

      First, to become a successful React front-end developer, I had to be successful in learning all parts of React. My only prior experience came from the Systems Development and Integration course. In the final project, I took it upon myself to learn and use React instead of jQuery, which gave me a decent understanding of basic concepts. However, I identified some areas of React where my knowledge was weak: hooks, styling, and security and best practices. I tackled these topics using company courses and lessons. In addition, I always looked for the next opportunity to work on the app and get practical experience with React. When doing any work on the app, I would make sure to get my team lead's opinion of my work to get a second opinion on the correctness of my code. 
      
      In addition, I also aimed to create a full React component within the web app during this first term. I would have to have understood how to use and follow the given designs and hold design reviews. Understand how to code following the practices, creating unit and integration tests, and styling. Knowing about all facets of the React framework was one aspect of programming, however being able to correctly create new components from this knowledge was another thing altogether. I made sure to take note of any design practices that were used when I worked with the app. For example, I learned how to migrate functionality within a component into a reusable hook. As a result, when it came time to create a new modal, I was already prepared on what practices to use and how it would be designed. 
      
      Furthermore, I also prioritized the goal to collaborate and communicate with other developers. Being able to collaborate with co-workers is an important skill to have in any workplace. It was beneficial to have collaboration when developing new features. When we encountered blockers, that is an issue we couldn’t solve on our own, it helpful to have my team help me out. In addition, my personality is very reserved and shy. With this placement, I took the opportunity to be more assertive and take the initiative in communication. Whenever I had the chance, I would ask my team members for help in their respective areas. For example, I would ask our team QA about the user flows in the web app. I often asked the other front ends on my team about my work to get feedback. As a result, I became more used to reaching out and communicated more often. 
      
      As for the resolution of these goals, I am very proud to say that I accomplished all three of these goals much quicker than I thought. It was a huge benefit to my overall goal to become a capable developer on the team. The first two goals represented my onboarding journey for front end development, given it was the skills I needed for day-to-day development. Moreover, building collaboration skills was a benefit in many ways. I was getting clarification and help on my many issues starting out, as well as returning the favor by helping team members out with their work. In reflection, the goals that I had set myself were an appropriate challenge. It helped me focus my efforts and opened many opportunities to contribute to the product.

      content: `For my placement at NCR, I joined a feature team as a front-end developer. At the Waterloo office, there were a pretty large number of teams. Most of the teams, including mine, would be working on a full stack software product. My team, being a feature team, would work on developing and delivering new features for one of NCR’s customers. 

    Given that I was assigned to a feature team, much of my work that I did were related to the continued development and improvement of the web app. These tasks included new feature development as well as general improvements to the product to better the user experience. In addition, our team followed the agile development methodology. Although I lacked experience following agile, I followed it to the best of my ability, and after a few sprints I started to understand the benefits of agile process and learned how to follow it. 
    
    The type of work I would be doing day to day varied, but it often was either working on a story, fixing bugs, or doing testing on the app. My work has allowed me to get a new view on implementing solutions in code. Throughout the work term, I learned new ways to approach programming problems. I often would get stuck on a singular design implementation, and after discussing it with my team members they would often suggest a different idea that could be implemented much cleaner. Some of the frameworks I became familiar with were Storybook and Formik libraries. Often the bugs that I was assigned and helped with related to Formik, since many components featured forms utilizing the libraries’ features. However, the implementations and usages differed across the app as different teams followed different designs. As a result, the number and variety of designs gave me a lot of experience and knowledge of Formik Library. My experience using storybook would come with my goal to create a React component, since creating a storybook for components was often required. In addition, I was also assigned to create a storybook for a very important form in the app around the halfway point in my term. This form, which appears in many of the user flows of the app, would be related to bugs assigned to our team. Creating a storybook would benefit developers by rendering it as an isolated component. This form had a lot of information it required from contexts and other components, so when I finally created a storybook for that form, I had gained a lot of experience with Storybook. 
    
    The main feature that my team and I worked on during my work term occupied around half of my work period. I was fortunate enough to join the team as they were starting development on a major feature to be shipped to our client. This enabled me to experience most stages of the development cycle for a large feature. I participated in many planning and discussions about the requirements, along with design reviews for the back-end development. A portion of the front-end work for this feature would be assigned to me as well. Joining the team as they were beginning development on such a large feature was a huge help to my learning. Despite the overwhelming number of topics to learn, I paid attention and asked questions during the meetings. Throughout the development I was able to stay caught up with what our customer required and understood the design requirements. As a result, once I felt capable of front-end development and worked on the story, I felt more confident knowing where my work fit into the final capability. 
    
    The skills that I found were most important to my job were the web development languages (HTML, CSS), React, and JavaScript. Development tools including git and Jira were used everywhere, as well as agile development cycles. Surprisingly, when I started out, I only had some knowledge of web dev languages and git. The rest of the skills I picked up on the job. In addition, during my job I also learned about project architecture, design planning, development cycles and sprints, web accessibility, web security, software development in general, along with a lot of definitions. `,

I am looking forward to what my remaining four months at NCR have in store!
