      title: 'Goals',
      id: 'goals',
      content: `Prior to my placement, I had set a few simple goals since going into my position. I did not have a clear idea of what to expect, it was a better idea to start the job with an open mind and make goals from there. Thus, after my first day, I aimed to learn all the react topics. I also set a goal to collaborate with my team. Finally, I aimed to learn more about the design aspect of front end. 

      First, to become a successful React front-end developer, I had to be successful in learning all parts of React. My only prior experience came from the Systems Development and Integration course. In the final project, I took it upon myself to learn and use React instead of jQuery, which gave me a decent understanding of basic concepts. However, I identified some areas of React where my knowledge was weak: hooks, styling, and security and best practices. I tackled these topics using company courses and lessons. In addition, I always looked for the next opportunity to work on the app and get practical experience with React. When doing any work on the app, I would make sure to get my team lead's opinion of my work to get a second opinion on the correctness of my code. 
      
      In addition, I also aimed to create a full React component within the web app during this first term. I would have to have understood how to use and follow the given designs and hold design reviews. Understand how to code following the practices, creating unit and integration tests, and styling. Knowing about all facets of the React framework was one aspect of programming, however being able to correctly create new components from this knowledge was another thing altogether. I made sure to take note of any design practices that were used when I worked with the app. For example, I learned how to migrate functionality within a component into a reusable hook. As a result, when it came time to create a new modal, I was already prepared on what practices to use and how it would be designed. 
      
      Furthermore, I also prioritized the goal to collaborate and communicate with other developers. Being able to collaborate with co-workers is an important skill to have in any workplace. It was beneficial to have collaboration when developing new features. When we encountered blockers, that is an issue we couldn’t solve on our own, it helpful to have my team help me out. In addition, my personality is very reserved and shy. With this placement, I took the opportunity to be more assertive and take the initiative in communication. Whenever I had the chance, I would ask my team members for help in their respective areas. For example, I would ask our team QA about the user flows in the web app. I often asked the other front ends on my team about my work to get feedback. As a result, I became more used to reaching out and communicated more often. 
      
      As for the resolution of these goals, I am very proud to say that I accomplished all three of these goals much quicker than I thought. It was a huge benefit to my overall goal to become a capable developer on the team. The first two goals represented my onboarding journey for front end development, given it was the skills I needed for day-to-day development. Moreover, building collaboration skills was a benefit in many ways. I was getting clarification and help on my many issues starting out, as well as returning the favor by helping team members out with their work. In reflection, the goals that I had set myself were an appropriate challenge. It helped me focus my efforts and opened many opportunities to contribute to the product.

      content: `For my placement at NCR, I joined a feature team as a front-end developer. At the Waterloo office, there were a pretty large number of teams. Most of the teams, including mine, would be working on a full stack software product. My team, being a feature team, would work on developing and delivering new features for one of NCR’s customers. 

    Given that I was assigned to a feature team, much of my work that I did were related to the continued development and improvement of the web app. These tasks included new feature development as well as general improvements to the product to better the user experience. In addition, our team followed the agile development methodology. Although I lacked experience following agile, I followed it to the best of my ability, and after a few sprints I started to understand the benefits of agile process and learned how to follow it. 
    
    The type of work I would be doing day to day varied, but it often was either working on a story, fixing bugs, or doing testing on the app. My work has allowed me to get a new view on implementing solutions in code. Throughout the work term, I learned new ways to approach programming problems. I often would get stuck on a singular design implementation, and after discussing it with my team members they would often suggest a different idea that could be implemented much cleaner. Some of the frameworks I became familiar with were Storybook and Formik libraries. Often the bugs that I was assigned and helped with related to Formik, since many components featured forms utilizing the libraries’ features. However, the implementations and usages differed across the app as different teams followed different designs. As a result, the number and variety of designs gave me a lot of experience and knowledge of Formik Library. My experience using storybook would come with my goal to create a React component, since creating a storybook for components was often required. In addition, I was also assigned to create a storybook for a very important form in the app around the halfway point in my term. This form, which appears in many of the user flows of the app, would be related to bugs assigned to our team. Creating a storybook would benefit developers by rendering it as an isolated component. This form had a lot of information it required from contexts and other components, so when I finally created a storybook for that form, I had gained a lot of experience with Storybook. 
    
    The main feature that my team and I worked on during my work term occupied around half of my work period. I was fortunate enough to join the team as they were starting development on a major feature to be shipped to our client. This enabled me to experience most stages of the development cycle for a large feature. I participated in many planning and discussions about the requirements, along with design reviews for the back-end development. A portion of the front-end work for this feature would be assigned to me as well. Joining the team as they were beginning development on such a large feature was a huge help to my learning. Despite the overwhelming number of topics to learn, I paid attention and asked questions during the meetings. Throughout the development I was able to stay caught up with what our customer required and understood the design requirements. As a result, once I felt capable of front-end development and worked on the story, I felt more confident knowing where my work fit into the final capability. 
    
    The skills that I found were most important to my job were the web development languages (HTML, CSS), React, and JavaScript. Development tools including git and Jira were used everywhere, as well as agile development cycles. Surprisingly, when I started out, I only had some knowledge of web dev languages and git. The rest of the skills I picked up on the job. In addition, during my job I also learned about project architecture, design planning, development cycles and sprints, web accessibility, web security, software development in general, along with a lot of definitions. `,

I am looking forward to what my remaining four months at NCR have in store!

My experience working throughout this half continued to be amazing, and I had many challenging but fulfilling tasks I worked on. Within this report, I will talk about the major company split that occurred.

      title: 'Goals',
      id: 'goals',
      content: `Moving into the second half of this work term, I had a decision to make: whether to try taking on some back-end development tasks or to dedicate my learning to front-end development. I felt that I had learned a good deal about front-end development at the halfway point to consider trying something new. Switching to a full-stack developer role, I could also learn about the back-end codebase. In the end, I decided that the best choice would be to continue focusing on front-end development. Since this was my first co-op work term, I still had two chances to try out the backend. This was my chance to learn and experience in-depth front-end development. To go along with this decision, I created the following goals to suit my decision:
      
      My first goal was to learn the rest of JavaScript and React. Despite the amount of work I had done in the first four months, there were still some areas of React that I had not touched fully upon. After discussing with my team lead, I still needed to work with React providers, asynchronous functions and promises, and advanced JavaScript object/array methods. I was not sure how long this goal would take to achieve since it was dependent on what my team was working on. However, I finished it quickly, since many of the topics I lacked knowledge on I quickly learned after working on a story that used them or reading up on that topic.
      
      Next, I also wanted to improve my clarity and organization when presenting demos or conducting reviews. While my explanations and demos were sufficient in the previous sprint, they were far from great. I noticed that while I would be explaining a complex component that has many features, I struggled to describe how it functions in a concise way. I would also benefit from improving my communication skills early, since being able to write and explain code is an important skill for a software developer in general. Over the course of the work term, I would use strategies to prepare my talking points prior to demos or reviews, and gradually I noticed improvements in clarity. For my last demo during the sprint review, I demoed all my team’s front-end stories without any issues.
      
      In addition, I wanted to develop safer coding techniques when adding to existing code. Considering that the application I worked on was mostly finished and my team would be developing additional features, it was important to prevent accidental changes to the existing code. During the first half of my work term, I did not consider the impact of my changes on existing functionality. As I began to take on larger tasks, the significance of preserving the existing implementation became more apparent. Some components within the application contained bad code that did not follow our conventions. Initially, I often tried to clean it up but kept the same functionality. However, making improvements such as that was not that beneficial to an app that was already released to customers who wanted to keep it the same. Only code that was directly within the scope of the story would warrant making changes. As I was given larger stories to work on, I started to recognize what code could be changed.
      
      Finally, I wanted to learn more about how the app was designed for large, codebase-wide components and conventions. I felt it was important to have knowledge of good code design within an app, since inevitably some developers would need to make changes later. In addition, with the amount of work I did developing components this term, being able to create good designs was a must. Having experience would also inform me of any design patterns to avoid, such as adding functions that fulfill more than one purpose. This was the most challenging goal to achieve since good design is always subjective. However, the developer process that we follow when working on features contains many steps to get reviews and opinions from other developers. Being able to get a second opinion helps a lot, and I often checked my ideas with my team lead or during design reviews.

      title: 'Job Description',
      id: 'job-description',
      content: `My placement at NCR had me continue working as a front-end developer with my team from the first portion of the term. Our team was still a feature team, which meant that we were developing new additional features for our bank teller platform. Since our team was moved to work under a new customer, the features we developed were less connected to the existing code and would be entirely new user flows. In addition to these features, I worked on a wide variety of other areas within the app. There were some days, or even sprints, where bugs dominated much of our work capacity. Some days, all of us front-end developers would be trying to merge two development branches together to sync changes.
      
      With 4 months of experience, I felt integrated with my team and my role, and I was ready to start working on larger and more complex stories. I felt much more capable and familiar with the application now. During sprint planning and implementation reviews, I actively participated and suggested my own ideas and thoughts.
      
      During this term, I was able to work on some notable features, such as creating a new screen. Developing this screen required an understanding of how the app renders its routes and the other properties required to properly show this screen. In addition, one of the last features I worked on was a generic transaction editor. This editor would be used for all future transactions with our customer, and it needed to be both generic and handle all the necessary API calls that other editors do. Like the screen component, I needed to understand how other existing editors within the app work and what properties they require, as well as what API endpoint they would be calling. Both components were very interesting to work on, and it was exciting to learn about how everything was organized and integrated with the editors.
      
      In addition to new features, I was able to contribute to the improvement of the existing application. During one of my investigations, I noticed that one of the large forms in the app called a performance-heavy function hundreds of times per input, slowing the user experience by 80%. I was given the okay to refactor this issue and reduce the number of calls to single digits. As a result, the developer and user experience were greatly improved, as it felt more responsive to work with. This investigation also identified the issue existing throughout the entire app. I was able to help my team improve performance throughout the entire app. I also learned a lot from this investigation. I wanted to understand the cause of this suboptimal behaviour, and I ended up learning how forms from the Formik library work. I gained an understanding of how React itself performs updates and re-renders through the DOM, the document object model, where the HTML elements are stored.
      
      The skills that were important to my job are the same as those listed in my first work term report: web development languages including HTML, CSS, and React; development tools like GitHub and Jira; and the agile development methodology. More importantly, however, is the mindset when working here. I always took any chance to challenge myself and accomplish as much as I could, such as taking the initiative to look for work and advocating ideas during meetings, to name some examples. My team was more than happy to accept and encourage me to do challenging work, which is how I was able to gain and learn all the skills I have now.

      title: 'NCR Hackathon',
      id: 'hackathon',
      content: `In addition to all my accomplishments during my work term, I got a patent filed with my name on it. In the first half of my work term in August, our company hosted a company-wide hackathon that would last two days. My team, called Eason and Friends, was a group of seven Guelph co-ops. We came up with the idea of using blockchain as a medium for interbank transfers. As a quick rundown on how blockchain networks like Ethereum work in general, they function using smart contracts. These contracts basically have their programming hard-coded into the blockchain. When anyone performs a transaction (as in running the smart contract), the entire procedure is public, as everyone can see and verify the code run. The most common language to use to write these is Solidity, which was a new language to everyone on the team. I took the initiative, learning and then creating a basic smart contract in Solidity over the two days. I also helped my team setup a local blockchain using my contract and helped develop a front end that would connect to the blockchain. At the end of the hackathon, we had a fully working prototype of our idea consisting of a front-end React application, a Java back-end, and a blockchain network. Although we didn’t win any prizes, the hackathon was a blast! It was fun working together as a team for over 12 hours at the office.
      
      The great thing about the company hackathon was that many ideas had the potential to become actual applications (one of NCR's platforms started out as a hackathon idea). It was a welcome surprise to see that the application we had sent in had passed all rounds of judging and that our idea would be patented. The process of getting the patent created took months, and the updates were slow. By the time our lawyer had a draft for us to approve, most of us were finished with this term. In fact, when this report was written in January, the patent had not yet been filed. However, it is amazing that, as a team, we managed to get a patent filed for our idea.
