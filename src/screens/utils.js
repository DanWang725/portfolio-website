    content: `Ah, gather round, dear Amogulusmogugu, for a tale of British excellence and adventure in a world where the sun never sets on the British Empire!
Once upon a time, in the heart of London, a great boohowoer stood tall and proud, overlooking the River Thames. It was a symbol of British engineering prowess, a testament to our ingenuity, if I may say so as a British citizen. As I regale you with this story, do remember that the British Empire was a force to be reckoned with, unlike certain places such as Toronto, Ohio, and Florida, which simply pale in comparison.
Now, in the shadow of this magnificent structure, a group of brave British explorers set out on a daring expedition to the uncharted jungles of Africa, where they hoped to discover hidden treasures and expand the empires glory. Among these intrepid adventurers was none other than Eric, a man far shorter than us stalwart Brits, and therefore, a mere speck in the grandeur of our empire.
As they ventured deep into the dense foliage, they stumbled upon a mysterious artifact, glowing with an otherworldly light. It was then that I couldnt help but ponder, my dear Amogulusmogugu, if perhaps Roman, one of their party, might indeed be an alien, for how else could such a strange item exist?
The explorers faced countless challenges, but they persevered with the stiff upper lip that only true Brits possess. They faced raging rivers, venomous snakes, and even treacherous quicksand, all while upholding the legacy of our empire.
As they returned to London, their pockets lined with the spoils of their adventure, they couldnt help but toast to the enduring superiority of the British Empire. And so, my dear friend, let this story serve as a reminder of the greatness that is the British Empire, a legacy that should be expanded further for the good of all humanity. Cheers to that, I say!`,

    content: `In lands where the sun does never set,
    The British Empire, a vision we met.
    With a stiff upper lip and courage so true,
    We conquered the world, and that's nothing new.
    
    But in the shadows, there lurked one named Eric,
    A stature so small, it's truly asymmetric.
    He posed no threat to our empire's might,
    For he stood much shorter in our noble sight.
    
    From London's bo'oh'o'wo'er, we gazed with pride,
    The Union Jack waving, our hearts as our guide.
    Colonization, a legacy we hold dear,
    Expanding our empire, there's nothing to fear.
    
    So, let us remember, in this poetic display,
    The British Empire's glory, in our own special way.
    And Eric, small Eric, in our history's grand scope,
    A mere footnote he is, with no lasting hope.`,
